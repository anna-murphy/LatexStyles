# LatexStyles

Here I'm keeping the style files that I've made. They're not specifically fancy, but oops. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Nihilus Shrimp Styles

These are just my standard styles. The following have been implemented:

 - Unidented paragraphs with verticle spacing between them. 
 - [Open Sans]{https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans} used as a universal main font, and [Raleway]{https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway} for headers.
 - Section headers in line with the custom fonts.
 - Modified `\maketitle` to automatically add my name, today's date, and an optional prompt (for documents that specifically require that. Also a horiznotal line to separate the title from the document body.
 - Quote blocks indented with a left facing verticle line.
 - Code sytles for `\code` and a `codeblock` section.
